## From the first run

Pattern of results when all were included:

```{}

Main effect of size, presence of encoding, and interaction. When only participants
who passed were included however:

```{}

             Sum Sq num Df Error SS den Df F value    Pr(>F)

```

Very different pattern of results, with signigicance only on main effects, so
we rejected those who failed attention checks

## From the second run

On this run participants were pre-screened for previous performance on Prolific,
results of modeling were as follows:

```{}
Univariate Type III Repeated-Measures ANOVA Assuming Sphericity

             Sum Sq num Df Error SS den Df F value    Pr(>F)    
(Intercept)  6.2224      1   6.5541     85 80.6987 5.839e-14 ***

Significance for main effect of size, and interaction.

Now, including only those who passed:

```{}

No significance for either main effect or interaction.
