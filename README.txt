initial_analysis.R is a quick and dirty file for trying out analysis. It is not formalised.

E1_report.Rmd is formalised. It is runnable in chunks and includes all data tidying, visualisation, analysis, and modelling.

The \data folder contains participant data, pass/fail data, and demographics data. All has been fully anonymised.

data_processing_for_payment.R does what it says on the tin. It takes the data downloaded from pavlovia and processes it, returning a list of participants to pay and a list of who to reject.
