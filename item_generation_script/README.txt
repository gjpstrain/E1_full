Use data_simulation.R to check predicted distribution of responses.

Use example_plots.R to quickly create example plots.

Use full_E1_prep_script.Rmd to create all r values, residuals, plots, masks, sizes, item numbers, and labels. 
NB in order to produce Small, Medium, and Large, and Present and Absent contrast encoding graphs,
some values in the script must be changed and re-run. Details of this are found in comments.
